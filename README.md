Description

Web page that introduces myself to TAs ans shows that I can use Git/FTP

Demo

I'll be attending my Friday section with Alain to do an WebEx demo. (It seems Alain is not hosing his section this week or I missed the link on the sections page for WebEx, so I will alternatively go to Katherine's In person section on Wednesday)

Details for teaching team:
No login required.
Site files are on Git in the subfolder "p1" from the central "CSCIE15" git.
I am using my own FTP server for this course, but have signed up for DO an account on DCE's Morpheus Server, so I may occasionally use those instead, depending on the project.
